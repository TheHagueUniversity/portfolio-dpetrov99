				<h3 class="smallheading"> Hello !</h3>
				<p> Welcome to my personal portfolio website. I really hope you enjoy it :)</p>
				<h4 class="smallheading"> General info</h4>
				<p> My name is Dimitar Petrov. I am a first year User Experience Design Bachelor Student in the Hague university of Applied Sciences. I am 20 years old. I come from Bulgaria and for the past 2 years I have been studying abroad in the Netherlands.</p>
				<h4 class="smallheading"> Career</h4>
				<p> Besides my studies, I also do a lot of side work. I read a lot of books about self-development, which help me grow as a person on a daily basis and help me improve every aspect of my life. Another thing I enjoy doing is finding and completing all sorts of online courses. For example, I've done courses in Web Development, Adobe XD, Java, Databases and soon I'll be starting a course in Swift, because I really want to learn to code for Apple Mobile devices. At the moment, I am not doing many personal projects yet, because first I want to gather all of the required knowledge, before I start doing something big.</p>
				<h4 class="smallheading"> Future Goals</h4>
				<p> My biggest goal in future is to become an entrepreneur and have my IT Company. It's a long way till I get there, but hopefully things go right. Before that main goal happens, I have smaller goals, which for now are gaining more and more knowledge and improving on the things I am most passionate about. After that I want to find a team of people with similar interests and together start building a big project, which will impact a lot of people worldwide.  </p>
