				<h2 class="projectText"> Digital unwrapping experience</h2>
				<h3> Discription</h3>
				<p> This was group project, where me and a fellow designer had to design 2 parts of a gift-giving experience. My partner designed a Card Personalization Tool and I created a digital unwrapping experience. Both parts had to made according to our user persona.
				</p>
				<p> I made the Digital Unwrapping experience as a game, where you have to complete 3 challenges in order to receive your final gift from your giver. The challenges are made like brain exercises where the receiver has to train his/her memory and think about past events and photos of him and his giver. For example, the first challenge is to guess where and which year a picture of them together was taken, only by using some hints, given by the giver. Another challenge is to guess what the user was wearing according to only seeing what his/her friend is wearing on half of a picture. In the end, the both giver and receiver have fun while completing this whole experience and they are more bonded to each other.</p>
				<p> Before making it digitaly accesible i first had to make a paper prototype and test it out with other students, in order to improve on my idea.</p>
